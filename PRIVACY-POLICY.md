# Service Fabric Explorer Helper Privacy Policy

Service Fabric Explorer Helper does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data or browsing information. The extension runs entirely within your browser and only modifies the Service Fabric Explorer page you have open to add helper actions. No analytics, telemetry, or external network requests are performed beyond those already required by Service Fabric Explorer itself.

If you have any questions about this policy, open an issue on the project repository.
